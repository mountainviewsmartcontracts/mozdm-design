# Issue Market

## About this Project

The goal of the project is to produce an open source platform that can be used to conduct research into the use of Incentive Algorithms and Prediction Markets as tooling for Community Managed Software.  

Our thesis is that if we develop a marketplace around software issues, allowing both Rewards and Predictions to be made, and allowing pluggable Reward Algorithms to be implemented, then researchers will be able to build and run tests of their Reward Algorithms in the real world, rapidly iterating.  We believe this will ultimately speed research into the use of marketplace incentives to improve outcomes for Community Managed Software.

We have a slide deck that provides a slightly longer intro: [Issue Market Intro Slides][deck]
