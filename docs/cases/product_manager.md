## Adjusting the Reward Algorithm

A reward algorithm kicks in when an market contract has been resolved.

Typically, contract resolution results in some payment being made. That payment could be made immediately, or in installments, or based on other conditions being met, such as code quality being verified, or other metrics.  

The Payout DSL is TBD.

Use Cases:

- Create Payout Algorithm
- Backtest Payout
- Publish Payout
- Retire Payout

Publishing payment terms might be restricted - Product owner or Industry Partner.
