Our goals are to speed research into the use of marketplace incentives to improve outcomes for Community Managed Software,  and  to make this platform useful in it's own right.  Desired characteristics of the Issue Market platform:   Decentralized - implemented as an Ethereum Dapp.  Extensible by Researchers - incentives can be modified and experimented with - easily!  Straightforward for Developers - to the extent possible, we'll use garden variety tech and write full test suites.  Unobtrusive - no changes should be required to existing project management systems (issue trackers, etc.), owners/managers of projects may participate as much or as little as desired.  Pseudononymous - we are after intelligence, and obtaining that info often requires a degree of respect for privacy.   Forward looking features we will prepare for in later iterations:   Example trading bots with Clear APIs  Tokenized, tradable contracts for each market agreement.  A DSL for researchers in which to write simple payout and scoring algos.",

Those issues are found in repositories. \n\n\nSo we need some way to grab issues from repos and bring them into the marketplace.  That thing is called an \"oracle\", and it needs to be configured by someone we're calling a Product Manager to grab details about issues, present them to the marketplace, and periodically update the status of those issues.  \n\n\n2) Users provide input to the market by making predictions and providing rewards.  This is 100% through the Dapp, and that info never reaches another system.  Users can put currency into escrow using the Dapp to incentivize others to participate by taking the other side of their contract and fixing issues or predicting new issues.\n\n\n3) Researchers can implement algorithms (for Scoring and Payout at first) using solidity (requires contract upgrade) or our DSLs (we have to write them first) directly in the Dapp.  Their results should ultimately be viewable through a dashboard.\n\n\nThere are other possibilities for this - Arbitrage, etc.  But lets start with those inputs first.\n\n\nHigh Level Processes Interaction Diagram\n\u00b6\n\n\nSo, to summarize all the players in this process:\n\n\nUsers\n interact with the marketplace Dapp through any web3 browser (i.e. firefox or chrome with metamask installed, status.im, etc.).  This is how they access the web3 apps to make predictions and interact with the other market players.\n\n\nThe \nOracle\n is effectively a configurable cron job that interacts with issue trackers and with the marketplace Dapp - it periodically feeds data on changes in issues to the market.\n\n\nThe \nDapp\n has a web interface that loads data from the ethereum blockchain.  The \nDapp\n contains at least two smart contracts (the market and the default reward algo)..\n\n\nThe \nMarket\n smart contract interacts with users through the web3 UI, and checks the blockchain for data on the currrent status of predictions and bugs when the page is loaded by a user.\n\n\nThe \nReward Algorithm\n smart contract is fed data about current bug statuses, and calculates payouts for users of the system.

            "text": "A reward algorithm kicks in when an market contract has been resolved.  Typically, contract resolution results in some payment being made. That payment could be made immediately, or in installments, or based on other conditions being met, such as code quality being verified, or other metrics.    One way we could make it easy to adjust the Reward Algorithm is to create a domain specific language (DSL) for defining the algorithm.  We've been calling this potential DSL, used to define the Reward/Payout algorithm a \"Payout DSL\"  The Payout DSL is TBD.  Use Cases for the Product Manager:   Create Payout Algorithm  Backtest Payout  Publish Payout  Retire Payout   Publishing payment terms might be restricted - Product owner or Industry Partner.",
